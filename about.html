                    <h1>About Us.</h1>
                    <p>STEM Mentorship is a non-profit organization that aims to help students tackle STEM admission
                        tests in intensive sessions and trial exams made by STEM students and reviewed by STEM teachers.
                        Each branch (English, Math, IQ, and science) will have its own mentors who will follow up with
                        students and answers their questions. Here in STEM Mentorship, we care about making our content
                        as constructive as possible, so we work on periodic exams to determine students' weaknesses and
                        work with them on it during sessions. STEM Mentorship is made under the supervision of STEM
                        teachers, and the mentors themselves are STEM students who have hands-on examination test and
                        successfully tackle it. There are about 25+ mentors in each section, with 5-7 mentors ready to
                        work with STEM seekers and hopefully can transfer their experience to them.

                        Last Year's Achievements.
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Last year, we conducted a survey and asked the students to fill out a form. 240 students
                        said that they were accepted into STEM, and this represents 70% of the students
                        who participated in the initiative. This is not counting the additional students that were
                        accepted into
                        Ain Shams and El-Dabaa. The following pie chart also shows the
                        percentage of acceptance into each school. For example, the students who were accepted into
                        STEM Maadi represent 13%, which is the largest percentage.
                        Also, 9% of the students were accepted into STEM October. The rest of the proportions are in the
                        chart.
                        We are proud of the fact that the students joined STEM Mentorship last year for guidance are now
                        guiding this year's students!
